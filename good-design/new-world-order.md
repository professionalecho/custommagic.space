title: New World Order

When designing commons for a set, there is a strict limit on what is considered accpetable complexity. This was outlined in Mark Rosewater's article ["New World Order"](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/new-world-order-2011-12-02), and Reuben Covington did a stellar primer on how to design for NWO [here](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/creativity/custom-card-creation/578926-primer-nwo-redflagging).

The list below, pulled from Reuben's primer, indicates every indicator that a card is red-flagged (not typical at common). The two rules of thumb to remember are that 1) Less than 20% of your commons overall should be red-flagged, and 2) Any red-flagged cards you keep in your set must make an important contribution to the set's theme or limited environment. Each red flag has a linked example of how not to do it - for more information, check out the primer.

*   Does it affect other permanents? (like [Kithkin Shielddare](https://scryfall.com/card/shm/10))
*   Does it have four or more lines of rules text? (like [Kinscaer Harpoonist](https://scryfall.com/card/shm/41))
*   Does it need to be read twice? (like [Dead Ringers](https://scryfall.com/card/apc/37))
*   Does it create card advantage? (like [Cultbrand Cinder](https://scryfall.com/card/shm/182))
*   Does it have the potential to kill multiple cards at once? (like [Boulderfall](https://scryfall.com/card/ths/115))
*   Can it create a loop? (like [Sprout Swarm](https://scryfall.com/card/fut/138))
*   Is it problematic in larger numbers? (like [Kindle](https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/137))
*   Does it use complex Magic terminology? (like [Dragon Breath](https://scryfall.com/card/arc/33))
