### Who is Zeu?

To trust that this guide will be useful to you, you have to know who I am. I have been a member of the custom Magic community since August of 2016 and have poured 2000+ hours into the refinement of my own projects and those of my fellow community members. I’m also a staff member at the Custom Magic Discord Server, and am highly active in the voice chat community there.

My projects:

* [Hollows of Lordran](http://www.planesculptors.net/set/hollows-of-lordran) (large set, 99.99% finished)
* Rakoa (large set, exploratory design)

Projects to which I’ve provided significant direction:

* [Ashes of Lothric](http://www.planesculptors.net/set/ashes-of-lothric) (large set, design)
