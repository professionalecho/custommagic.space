# The Custom Magic Space

The Custom Magic Space is a primer/reference guide for creators of custom Magic: the Gathering cards. I've been working on the site for four years or so, and people seem to like it. At the suggestion of some of those people, I've put it on GitHub to improve the site's content. Magic design is always changing, and the site should change to reflect that.

A disclaimer: I'm really not a developer. I'm a designer, and I basically don't know what I'm doing at all with GitHub. If I make mistakes, please be patient as I try to figure things out. But if you want to help me out, feel free!

custommagic.space runs on Jekyll and Bootstrap.
