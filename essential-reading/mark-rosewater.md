        <p>Mark Rosewater is Magic's Leader Designer, and has probably written more about designing cards than anyone else in the world in his regular column <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/making-magic-archive">Making Magic</a>. Any designer can learn a lot from any of these columns, but some are specifically geared towards card design.</p>

            <strong>Mistake 1:</strong> The Card Is Too Complicated<br/>
            <strong>Mistake 2:</strong> The Abilities on the Card Have No Synergy<br/>

            <strong>Mistake 4:</strong> The Card Doesn’t Work Within the Rules<br/>
            <strong>Mistake 5:</strong> The Card Is Undercosted, Overpowered, or Simply “Bah-roken”
