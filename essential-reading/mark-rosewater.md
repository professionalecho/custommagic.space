Mark Rosewater is the Head Designer of Magic, and has probably written more about designing cards than anyone else in the world in his [Making Magic](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/making-magic-archive) column.

*   [Design 101](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/design-101-2003-04-21) describes the common mistakes most novice designers make.

    **Mistake 1:** The Card Is Too Complicated  
    **Mistake 2:** The Abilities on the Card Have No Synergy  
    **Mistake 3:** The Card Ignores Basic Design Rules of Magic  
    **Mistake 4:** The Card Doesn't Work Within the Rules  
    **Mistake 5:** The Card Is Undercosted, Overpowered, or Simply "Bah-roken"  

*   [Design 102](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/design-102-2004-07-12) contains the things Mark feels Magic designers could do to get better.

    **1:** Know Magic History  
    **2:** Play Magic  
    **3:** Design a Lot of Cards  
    **4:** Know What You Want  
    **5:** Play With the Cards  
    **6:** Have Other People Play With the Cards  
    **7:** Give a Set Time to Breathe  

*   [Design 103](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/design-103-2006-11-06) has some more advanced mistakes.

    **Mistake 1:** Making the Audience Do Something They Don't Want To Do  
    **Mistake 2:** Making the Audience Do Unnecessary Work  
    **Mistake 3:** Don't Put Things They Care About Out of Their Control  
    **Mistake 4:** You Force The Players hand Too Much  
    **Mistake 5:** Making Cards Match The Wrong Audience  

*   [Design 104](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/design-104-2013-08-16) takes Dr. Roger von Oech's "creator roles" to explore four more mistakes.

    **The Explorer's Mistake:** "It Hasn't Been Done" Is Not a Reason to Do Something  
    **The Artist's Mistake:** You Try to Be Too Literal  
    **The Judge's Mistake:** The Card is Awesome but Not For This Set  
    **The Warrior's Mistake:** You Can't Fight For Everything  

His Nuts and Bolts series go into explicit details about designing a set.

Rosewater also applied Dieter Ram's Ten Principles for Good Design to Magic.

*   [The Ten Principles of Good Design, Part 1](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ten-principles-good-design-part-1-2010-05-03)
*   [The Ten Principles of Good Design, Part 2](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ten-principles-good-design-part-2-2010-05-17)

    **2:** Good design makes a product useful.  
    **3:** Good design is aesthetic.  
    **4:** Good design helps us to understand a product.  
    **5:** Good design is unobtrusive.  
    **6:** Good design is honest.

    **9:** Good design is concerned with the environment.  
    **1:** Good design is as little design as possible.  

Finally, these two articles cover issues of complexity, especially in commons.
