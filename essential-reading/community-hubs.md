These are the biggest sites for custom card creation communities.

*   [The Custom Magic Discord](https://discord.gg/HjJBDc9)
*   [Magic Set Editor forums](http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/forum)
*   [The "Custom Magic Card" tag on Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/search/custom+magic+card)
*   [/r/custommagic on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/custommagic)
*   [MTGSalvation's Custom Card Creation forum](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/creativity/custom-card-creation)
*   [You Make the Card on NoGoblinsAllowed](http://forum.nogoblinsallowed.com/viewforum.php?f=17)

Any one of these places would be happy to critique your cards, advise on wording, or chat about the color pie, so come and get involved! There are also a huge number of already completed sets that you can play with! You can find lists of those [here (MSE forum)](http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/forum/6) and [here (MTGSalvation)](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/creativity/custom-card-creation/custom-set-creation-and/378924-the-official-completed-set-collection).

Other great community projects include:

*   [MTG.Design](http://www.mtg.design): A web-based Magic card creator. Much better than Cardsmith, which is to say not garbage..
*   [Planesculptors](http://www.planesculptors.net): A set database and web drafter. Absolutely essential for finished sets.
*   [Multiverse](http://www.magicmultiverse.net/): A database for your sets. Useful if outdated.
*   [Remaking Magic](http://remakingmagic.libsyn.com/): A custom MTG design podcast. Now non-functional, but worth listening back.
*   [RoboRosewater](https://twitter.com/RoboRosewater): Cards generated by neural network. Puts us all to shame.
