Hello there! This website is a primer for creators of custom *Magic: the Gathering* cards. If that sounds like your kind of thing, but you don't know where to start, we can show you! Click [here](getting-started/programs) to get started. If you know the basics, but want to find out more, feel free to browse at your leisure.

We're also trying to be a one-stop shop for the more fiddly parts of the hobby, such as specific templating of cards and redflagging cards. You can see information about these on their respective pages, and you can bookmark specific pages to have open when you're crafting your next great set.

We are proud to host Zeu's guide to ["Fun and Success with Custom Magic"](/zeu-s-guide/introduction), which can be really useful for learning about the kind of things you can make in the hobby, tips for making cards appealing and fun, and how best to utilise the community of the Custom Magic Discord.

The Custom Magic Space aims to be as comprehensive as possible, so if you have an idea for content that we could use, we'd love to hear from you! Send me an email [here](mailto:patrick.lickman@gmail.com).

Enjoy the site!
